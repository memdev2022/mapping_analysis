WELCOME TO THE PROJECT

# Mapping Review on Memory Development
<strong>All data and scripts from the project are available in this repository</strong>

We have created an interactive web application that provides full access to the database and enables users to select and visualize the methodological variables from any individual task entry or an overlay of multiple task entries with HEB. Importantly, our application enables users to identify related publications (e.g., top 10 most similar entries) based on the similarity scores for a given seed entry. Unique to our methods-focused database, this data-driven search feature introduces a powerful tool for literature search that is currently not available with any other database. Further, in order to accumulate resources for expansion, our web application
includes a “suggestion” tab that allows users to input publications that they believe to meet our inclusion criteria but are not yet included in the database.
